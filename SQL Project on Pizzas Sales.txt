Steps of Analysis

1Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve Total Number of Orders
Count the total number of unique orders placed in the dataset.
Use SQL aggregation (COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)) to determine the total orders.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate Total Revenue
Sum the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
Use SQL aggregation (SUM(price * quantity)) to calculate the total revenue.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Identify the Highest-Priced Pizza
Find the pizza with the highest unit price.
Use ORDER BY price DESC and limit results to 1.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Identify the Most Common Pizza Size Ordered
Count the occurrences of each pizza size in orders.
Use GROUP BY size and ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC to find the most popular size.

5Ô∏è‚É£ List the Top 5 Most Ordered Pizza Types
Retrieve the top 5 pizza types with the highest order quantities.
Use GROUP BY pizza_type and ORDER BY SUM(quantity) DESC with LIMIT 5.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Find Total Quantity of Each Pizza Category Ordered
Join necessary tables to link pizza categories and order quantities.
Use GROUP BY category and SUM(quantity) to calculate total orders per category.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Determine Distribution of Orders by Hour
Extract the hour from the order timestamp.
Use GROUP BY hour and COUNT(order_id) to determine order frequency per hour.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Category-Wise Distribution of Pizzas
Join tables to categorize pizzas and count the number of orders per category.
Use GROUP BY category and SUM(quantity).

9Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate Average Number of Pizzas Ordered Per Day
Group orders by date and calculate the daily average pizza orders.
Use GROUP BY order_date and AVG(quantity).

üîü Determine the Top 3 Most Ordered Pizza Types by Revenue
Compute total revenue for each pizza type (SUM(price * quantity)).
Use ORDER BY revenue DESC and LIMIT 3.
